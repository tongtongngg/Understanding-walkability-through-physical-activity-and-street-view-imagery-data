"""Our project focussed on understanding how humans make spatial decisions which is a key to 
developing realistic human mobility models which are especially important for applications 
such as estimating migratory flows, traffic forecasting, urban planning, and epidemic modeling"""

"""The project will spand over an entire semester, inclueding the 13 weeks part, and a more intense 3 week course"""
